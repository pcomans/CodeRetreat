Conway's Game of Life

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused
  by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
  generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
  overcrowding.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live
  cell, as if by reproduction.
- Assume that every cell outside the array is dead.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first
generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to
every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the
discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick.
